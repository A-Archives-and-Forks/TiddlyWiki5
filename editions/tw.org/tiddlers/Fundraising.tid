TiddlyWiki's nature allows us to operate https://tiddlywiki.com/ without any running costs. (See [[Infrastructure]] for details of how we currently use the free ~GitHub's Pages service for the majority of our hosting requirements).

We do need a small amount of money on an ongoing basis to pay the costs of running our own discussion forum at https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/. We are also interested in exploring ways to help fund contributors who face financial barriers to giving time to the project.

We use Open Collective to allow you to contribute towards these costs. You can contribute a one-off donation, or make an ongoing monthly commitment. Find out more:
