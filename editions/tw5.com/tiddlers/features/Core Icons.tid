!! Introduction

TiddlyWiki includes over 100 custom vector icons. They feature in the user interface and are also available for authors to use in their own applications. See [[Icon Gallery]] for a complete listing.

!! Usage

The core icons are used by transcluding them. For example:

<<wikitext-example-without-html """{{$:/core/images/new-image-button}}
""">>

The core icons are parameterised. The first parameter `size` specified the size at which the icon should be rendered:

<<wikitext-example-without-html """{{$:/core/images/picture|64px}}
<$transclude $tiddler="$:/core/images/picture" size="32px"/>
""">>

Some icons take further parameters to customise how they are rendered. For example, the $:/core/images/new-journal-button icon takes an additional parameter `day` that specifies the day of the month that should be shown on the calendar. It defaults to the current date if not specified

<<wikitext-example-without-html """{{$:/core/images/new-journal-button|48px|17}}
<$transclude $tiddler="$:/core/images/new-journal-button" day="17"/>
""">>

The core icons are implemented as embedded [[SVG elements|Using SVG]], and not as full-blown SVG images. This means that they can be styled using CSS. For example, the CSS property `fill` can be used to change the colour of the icons. For example:

<<wikitext-example-without-html """<span style="fill: red;">{{$:/core/images/opacity}}</span>
""">>
