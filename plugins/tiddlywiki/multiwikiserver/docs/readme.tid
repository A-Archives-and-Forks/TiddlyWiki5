title: $:/plugins/tiddlywiki/multiwikiserver/readme

This plugin extends the TiddlyWiki 5 server running on Node.js to be able to host multiple wikis, which can share content or be independent.

Before using the plugin, it is necessary to install dependencies by running the following command in the root of the ~TiddlyWiki5 repository:

```
npm install
```

To start the server:

```
tiddlywiki editions/multiwikiserver --listen
```

Then visit the sample wikis in a browser:

* http://127.0.0.1:8080/wiki/recipe-rho - bag-alpha, bag-beta
* http://127.0.0.1:8080/wiki/recipe-sigma - bag-alpha, bag-gamma
* http://127.0.0.1:8080/wiki/recipe-tau - bag-alpha
* http://127.0.0.1:8080/wiki/recipe-upsilon - bag-alpha, bag-gamma, bag-beta

Note that changes are written to the topmost bag in a recipe.

Note that until syncing is improved it is necessary to use "Get latest changes from the server" to speed up propogation of changes.

To run the tests:

```
./bin/test.sh
```
