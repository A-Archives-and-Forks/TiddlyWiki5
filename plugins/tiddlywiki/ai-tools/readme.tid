!! AI Tools for TiddlyWiki

This plugin adds integrated LLM conversations to the TiddlyWiki platform.

# Click the {{||$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/ai-tools/page-menu}} icon in the sidebar to open a new conversation
# Choose the server from the dropdown:
#* ''Locally running Llamafile server'' - LLlamafile is an open source project that lets you distribute and run LLMs as a single file. The files are large, typically 4+ gigabytes but offer reasonable performance on modern hardware, and total privacy
#* ''~OpenAI Service'' - ~OpenAI is a commercial service that offers paid APIs for accessing some of the most sophisticated LLMs that are available. ~OpenAI requires tokens to be purchased for API usage (this is entirely separate from ~ChatGPT subscriptions)
# Type a prompt for the LLM in the text box
#* If using ~OpenAI it is possible to attach a single image to a prompt
# Click "Send" and wait for the output of the LLM
