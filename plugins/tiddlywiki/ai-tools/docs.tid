!! Live AI Conversations in ~TiddlyWiki

# Click the {{||$:/plugins/tiddlywiki/ai-tools/page-menu}} icon in the sidebar to open a new conversation
# Choose the server from the dropdown:
#* ''Locally running Llamafile server'' - LLlamafile is an open source project that lets you distribute and run LLMs as a single file. The files are large, typically 4+ gigabytes but offer reasonable performance on modern hardware, and total privacy
#* ''~OpenAI Service'' - ~OpenAI is a commercial service that offers paid APIs for accessing some of the most sophisticated LLMs that are available. ~OpenAI requires tokens to be purchased for API usage (this is entirely separate from ~ChatGPT subscriptions)
# Type a prompt for the LLM in the text box
#* If using ~OpenAI it is possible to attach a single image to a prompt
# Click "Send" and wait for the output of the LLM

!! Import ~ChatGPT Conversation Archives

# [[Follow the instructions|https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7260999-how-do-i-export-my-chatgpt-history-and-data]] to request an export of your ~ChatGPT data
# You will receive a link to download your data as a ZIP file
# Download and unzip the file
# Locate the file `conversations.json` within the archive and import it into your TiddlyWiki
# Visit the ''tools'' tab and locate your `conversations.json` tiddler
# Click the associated ''import'' button
# See the imported conversations listed in the ''tools'' tab
# The imported tiddler `conversations.json` is no longer required and can be deleted
